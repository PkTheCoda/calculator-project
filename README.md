My take on TOP's JS course (Calculator Challenge)

Live Preview: [Here](https://pkthecoda.github.io/calculator-project/)

I spent a total of 2.5 days on this project, about an hour each day! I have no words for how fun this project is! It really puts your skills to the test when it comes to DOM manipulation, UI, and styling. I learned a lot of different skills throughout this project and it helped me understand a lot of Javascript!

What I've learned:

- How to round numbers
- Difference between "getelementbyclass" and "querySelector"
- Improved my DOM manipulation skills ten-fold
- Tinkered with CSS grid and added onto my flexbox skills for the calculator UI

It definitely wasn't an easy project, the hardest part for me was figuring out how to get the numbers to display on the screen. Not only numbers, but decimal points, operations, and how to calculate everything when the user presses the equal sign. There were times when I considered giving up on this project for a bit, but in the end, perserverance got the best of me, and I finished it!
